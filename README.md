# Previous version of Blu (Adding more features and API's)

# About:
A web application that allows users to seamlessly find gamers from all around the world to play with and to create friendships. Our purpose is to connect gamers to create a team and ease the "pre-gaming" set up process.

------------------------------------

# Steps to start up the application:

  1. Clone down the repository to your local machine. 
  2. Open up the repository on vscode. 
  3. Open up a terminal at the repository directory.
  4. Type ```$ npm install``` in the terminal.
  5. Once you have installed all the needed dependencies type ```$ npm run build```.
  6. Then type ```$ cd database``` and then type ```$ mysql -u root -p <schema.sql```. 
  7. Then to run the seed type ```$ node seed.js```. (Still in the database directory)
  7. If the seed is successful type ```$ npm start```. (This will start up the application)
  8. Then lastly, open up a browser and type in http://localhost:3000/.
  9. You should then be all wrapped up to use our application!
